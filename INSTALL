There is no sophisticated installation procedure for this small utility.

=========
Building:
=========

For the impatient: the steps to build it are:

1) Copy config_mk.template to config.mk and edit it (it is commented)
2) Run "make"
3) There should be an executable named "svnwcrev" in the root folder
   now. Place it anywhere in your PATH.
   
=============
Requirements:
=============

For obvious reasons you will need the headers of Subversion and APR,
and their libraries to link the executable. I have tested this tool
with Subversion 1.7.0, but it should work with all versions from
1.0 on with almost all up-to-date distributions. The APR version has
to be the one that comes with the Subversion sources.

NOTE:
Do not ask me about errors like
  "undefined reference to `svn_utf_initialize'"
or
  "error: apr_pools.h: File or folder not found"

because then you either did not edit config.mk properly or you do not
have the Subversion/APR headers or libraries in place.
